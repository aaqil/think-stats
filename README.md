 __Conditional Distribution:__  As the name itself indicates that the distribution of data based on a condition.
For example, you are given a large set of data and you are interested in a particular item in that data, and its characteristics and how it varies in accordance with the data can be known using Conditional Distribution.
 
 
 For example, you could say we’re only interested in how computers are used for English classes or the Social Sciences. The highlighted areas in the chart below are the conditional distributions for Math (blue) and Social Sciences (yellow).

Above example is a small demonstration of how we can know a particular relation. In reality, we are given large chunks of data and are asked to extract the data.

__Pareto Distribution:__ The Pareto distribution is named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto, who
used it to describe the distribution of wealth.
Since then, it has been used to describe phenomena in the natural and social sciences including sizes of cities and towns, sand particles and meteorites, forest fires and earthquakes.

It is defined by a shape parameter α ( slope parameter or Pareto Index) and a location parameter, X

In the real world, it has two main applications like:

1.To model the distribution of incomes.
1.To model the distribution of city populations.

The Pareto distribution is expressed as:

F(x) = 1 – (k/x)^α
where
x is the random variable
k is the lower bound of the data
α is the shape parameter.
