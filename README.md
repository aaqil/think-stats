 __Conditional Distribution:__  As the name itself indicates that the distribution of data based on a condition.
For example, you are given a large set of data and you are interested in a particular item in that data, and its characteristics and how it varies in accordance with the data can be known using Conditional Distribution.
 
 
 For example, you could say we’re only interested in how computers are used for English classes or the Social Sciences. The highlighted areas in the chart below are the conditional distributions for Math (blue) and Social Sciences (yellow).

Above example is a small demonstration of how we can know a particular relation. In reality, we are given large chunks of data and are asked to extract the data.

__Pareto Distribution:__ The Pareto distribution is named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto, who
used it to describe the distribution of wealth.
Since then, it has been used to describe phenomena in the natural and social sciences including sizes of cities and towns, sand particles and meteorites, forest fires and earthquakes.

It is defined by a shape parameter α ( slope parameter or Pareto Index) and a location parameter, X

In the real world, it has two main applications like:

1.To model the distribution of incomes.
1.To model the distribution of city populations.

The Pareto distribution is expressed as:

F(x) = 1 – (k/x)^α <br>
where<br>
x is the random variable<br>
k is the lower bound of the data<br>
α is the shape parameter.<br>

* __Survival Function:__ It is also referred as a tail function or reliability function Sometimes. 	This is just the probability of values greater than X. <br>
For example, whenever you are looking at the population in the India and want to know what proportion of population is greater than 10 million.

__Cumulative distribution function:__ <br>
Cumulative distribution function of a Pareto random variable with parameters α and x<sub>m</sub>  is <br>

where x<sub>m</sub> ( or k) is the minimum possible value.

## Normal distribution: <br>
Normal (or __Gaussian__) distribution is a continuous probability distribution.
It is sometimes called as __Bell Curve__. <br>

__For Example:__ <br>
The Bell curve is seen in tests like IIT, AIEEE,CAT etc. The bulk of students will score the average (C), while smaller numbers of students will score a B or D. An even smaller percentage of students score an F or an A. This creates a distribution that resembles a bell . The bell curve is symmetrical. Half of the data will fall to the left of the mean; half will fall to the right.<br>
